                  Dr. Germ√°n A. Cadenas (he/his/el) is an Assistant Professor of
                  Counseling Psychology at Lehigh University. He is a formerly
                  undocumented immigrant from Latin America. As a
                  scholar-activist, he has been involved in the movement for
                  immigrant rights for over a decade. He completed a PhD in
                  Counseling Psychology at Arizona State University, and a
                  Doctoral Internship and Postdoctoral Fellowship at the

                  <br />
                  His academic work is community-based and focuses on the
                  psychology of immigration and on critical consciousness as a
                  tool for social justice. He particularly examines the impact
                  of immigration policy on the psychological wellbeing,
                  education, career/work, and health of Latinx immigrants. His
                  work also includes the development and validation of
                  strategies for mental health service providers and educators
                  working with immigrants. His work has been externally funded
                  and published widely. He serves as Associate Editor of Journal
                  of Counseling Psychology, and is on the Editorial Boards of
                  Journal of Diversity in Higher Education and Journal of Career
                  Development.

                  for humane federal immigration policies, and briefing Congress
                  on research conducted with the National Latinx Psychological
                  Association (NLPA) regarding COVID-19 among Latinxs. He serves
