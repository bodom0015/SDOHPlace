##### *Earlier this year, we invited [fifteen fellows](https://sdohplace.org/fellows) to develop their own web mapping applications, centered on equity and designed with communities in mind, using the [SDOH & Place Toolkit](https://toolkit.sdohplace.org/). From July to September, we'll feature final fellow applications each week.*

### **App Motivations**

Beth created her SDOH & Place project idea, "Hope, Education and ArT," to serve as a model for other national and international projects that are working to provide environmental solutions within communities. 

Beth is developing the HEATChicago app to serve as a prototype for this work. It identifies outdoor spaces where art eases the anxiety of difficult climate dialogues and/or be used to express what is happening around us â€“ both the problems and the solutions. It identifies community gardens that invite participation and provide a local food source. It highlights audio storytelling projects that give history to our great city.

The target audience for this work includes members of the Chicago community and Intergenerational conservationists with a passion for promoting Environmental Justice. 

### **Features**

It can be used on a computer or a mobile phone. When on a phone, it can zoom into where the user is located to allow them to visit nearby assets. 

In addition to visiting the garden, users can click on the link to listen to an audio collection of Living History stories from the neighborhood.

The following curriculum ideas are embedded as links within the assets. Some suggestions include: "More than One Story" activity, which could be used in a gathering space to help the participants get to know each other better. There is also a link to a Tree Identification Guide in the "Chicago Tree" link, enabling students to explore nearby trees. Additionally, the "Chicago Sculpture" exhibit links provide ideas for interacting with the "Chevron" sculpture or learning more about the artist behind the "Caminantes" exhibit by visiting the Mexican Fine Arts Museum.

We are exploring ways the user could click on the neighborhood and add information about either a art installation, a gathering space or upload a photo of an environmental concern.
