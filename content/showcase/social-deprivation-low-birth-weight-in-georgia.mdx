##### *Earlier this year, we invited [fifteen fellows](https://sdohplace.org/fellows) to develop their own web mapping applications, centered on equity and designed with communities in mind, using the [SDOH & Place Toolkit](https://toolkit.sdohplace.org/). From July to September, we'll feature final fellow applications each week.*

### **App Motivations**

This data dashboard was created to visualize social depravation (in this case, depravation meaning lack of resources) and adverse health outcomes. The app allows users to visualize the county-level low birth weight rate by racial groups (Black or White) and Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) for the year of 2000, 2010, and 2020 for Georgia. 

The state of Georgia thus far has lacked a dashboard to visualize the connection of social deprivation and adverse birth outcomes, this data application created by Wei will help to alleviate that gap.

While anyone in Georgia and beyond can check out Wei's data application, the main target audience for this app is public health professionals in Georgia.
