### **App Motivations**

We created this strengths-based map in response to a need expressed by the Nebraska Urban Indian Health Coalition (NUIHC), a community partner of UNO. The NUIHC wanted to develop a resource showing the locations of their collaborating partners, and services where they refer their clients to, in order to better serve clients looking for substance use and mental health support.

This application is a web-based asset map containing the location, address, phone number, opening hours, and appointment modalities of services to which NUIHC sends their clients for further support.

Indigenous people in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa looking for help with substance use or mental health problems.

### **Features**

The data application is intentionally simple in design. Services are color-coded by category (for example, red diamonds to indicate medical services; blue circles to indicate transportation services). In addition, we included the location and contact information of the major Indigenous tribes served by the NUIHC so that Indigenous clients can also reach out to the tribes for support.
