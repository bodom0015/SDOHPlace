### **App Motivations**

Madeline created this dashboard to connect gender, sexuality, and health in a way that highlighted the importance of state context. Inequality based on gender and sexuality is increasingly different across states in the U.S. For example, in some states, abortion access is restricted, laws make it more difficult for same-sex couples to build families, and transgender people are banned from using public facilities that align with their gender identity. There is growing academic evidence that living in more unequal state contexts is associated with poorer population health outcomes. Madeline's dashboard allows the user to explore these associations – the changes in state context over time, across states, and their associations with mental and physical health outcomes for specific gender and sexuality groups. 

The target audience of this dashboard is diverse - it includes researchers, policy makers, students, and individuals who are interested in or personally affected by these state contexts. For instance, LGBTQ+ users might use this dashboard to explore what types of non-discrimination protections are available in their state. Or, users moving to a new state might explore whether health disparities are more pronounced in that state.   

### **Features**

The dashboard includes a panel of health data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System – a large national health survey that includes information about diverse gender and sexuality. Bar charts display weighted proportions of five health outcomes (frequent mental distress, 2 or more chronic conditions, one or more functional limitation, lacking a primary care provider, and poor or fair self-rated health) across gender (cisgender women, cisgender men, and transgender adults) and sexuality groups (heterosexual, bisexual, and gay or lesbian adults). Users can toggle between health outcomes by gender and sexuality to change the visualization. The dashboard includes a second panel that allows users to explore three structural inequality scores – transgender rights, gay rights, and structural sexism – displayed on a map of the United States. The first scores capture legal inequality where higher scores indicate more inequality in the laws and policies governing transgender and gay rights. The structural sexism scale captures systematic inequality in power and resources between (presumably mostly cisgender) men and women across economic, legal, and cultural domains. Higher scores indicate more inequality between men and women. The dashboard also includes a menu of specific indicators, those individual laws, policies, or measures of inequality that are used to calculate structural inequality scores. Users can use this menu to navigate to supplemental maps displaying how the presence of various laws or measures of inequality vary across states and over time.  

Clicking on a specific state on the structural inequality map will filter the health data to display health information for only that state. There are some interesting associations between high-inequality states and poorer health outcomes for sexual and gender minorities. However, this is not a universal pattern, suggesting that there are other important structural factors at play here.

### **Upcoming Features**

There is still much work they would like to do, including:

1. Adding more resource types (beyond food and recreation assets). 
2. Adding information about benefits, hours open, populations served, and more. 
3. Overlaying a map of public transit.

While there is ongoing work, this is a working draft that can still be accessed by Montgomery, Alabama community members.

Prior to her current role, Amy conducted research on remotely sensed early detection of cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh and transboundary water policy of the Ganges River under multiple potential climate futures. At UNC, she received the University’s inaugural Environmental Graduate Research Scholarship for her work on access to safe sanitation in the United States. Amy continues to work the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health Humanitarian Health Initiative as the program coordinator and as a technical advisor for community health and water and sanitation in Nicaragua.
