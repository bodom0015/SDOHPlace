## Background


Studies have shown that some groups and individuals in society have a hard time getting around not because they do not want to travel, but rather because they have trouble reaching important places like work, school, healthcare, and healthy food etc. Thus, as more and more people rely on transportation for their daily needs, either by choice or because they must, so is the need to understand equity measurements when it comes to public transit operations. In its generic form, transit equity is about making sure transit resources are shared among people with different abilities and needs fairly. A fair public transit system does not just mean being able to reach destinations at the least distance/time per se, it also means being able to reach activities at the least cost (money, least obstacles), the diversity and quality of opportunities reachable, the facilities and infrastructure that support such movement  and who can use it.


Public transit equity considers all public transport modes available such as Subway, Rail, Bus, Ferry etc. and non-motorized modes (Walk, Bicycle etc.), but you can also calculate and compare with other modes (Car). With regard to walking specifically, access to transit stops is often the most time-consuming part of a person's journey- being the quickest or shortest route.


While this guide does not cover everything about public transportation and all modes, it is a good starting point for anyone interested in understanding and measuring public transit equity, whether new to the subject or already familiar with public transportation  policy. It is a collection of existing and different ways and information that can be used to study equity in relation to public transit.


## Ideas to Keep In Mind When Measuring Spatial Public Transit Equity

<details><summary>1. Access varies depending on where you are (origin)</summary>Imagine living in downtown Chicago, where it is easy to catch a bus or hop on the subway to get to work, visit friends, or run errands. If the transit system is well-connected, and stops are just a short walk from your home, this could make it convenient for you to rely on public transportation. Now, if someone lives in a small rural town where public transit might be limited to a few bus routes that only run a couple of times a day. The nearest bus stop could be several miles away, making it inconvenient to rely on public transportation. At the same time, some individuals may find it convenient to obtain services near their work or shopping locations, indicating that daily activity spaces other than residential locations can be more representative of origin in measuring public transit calculations. This highlights the importance of origin (location) in accessibility decision making.</details>

<details><summary>2. Access takes in account the difficulty of traveling to a destination</summary>Consider the example below:<ul><li><strong>Apartment A</strong>: You are considering living in this apartment and the nearest bus stop is really close - only a 5-minute walk, and the bus comes often- every 10 minutes. However, the bus ride to downtown takes 20 minutes. Remember, walking to transit stops is often the most time-consuming part of a person's journey. Here, we can say that the difficulty involved in getting to your destination is low since the stop is closer, and the bus is frequent.</li><li><strong>Apartment B</strong>: You are considering living in this apartment and the nearest train station is close, only a 5-minute walk, but the train comes only every 30 minutes, and the ride downtown takes 25 minutes. The short walk is convenient, but the infrequent service increases the effort required as you may need to plan your trips carefully to avoid long waits, potentially limiting your flexibility and convenience.</li><li><strong>Apartment C</strong>: You are considering living in this apartment and the nearest subway station is a bit far - 15-minute walk, but the subway comes every 5 minutes, and the ride downtown takes only 10 minutes. The effort is higher due to the longer walk, but the subway is faster once you are on it.</li></ul></details>
