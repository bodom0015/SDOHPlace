## Background


Studies have shown that some groups and individuals in society have a hard time getting around not because they do not want to travel, but rather because they have trouble reaching important places like work, school, healthcare, and healthy food etc. Thus, as more and more people rely on transportation for their daily needs, either by choice or because they must, so is the need to understand equity measurements when it comes to public transit operations. In its generic form, transit equity is about making sure transit resources are shared among people with different abilities and needs fairly. A fair public transit system does not just mean being able to reach destinations at the least distance/time per se, it also means being able to reach activities at the least cost (money, least obstacles), the diversity and quality of opportunities reachable, the facilities and infrastructure that support such movement  and who can use it.


Public transit equity considers all public transport modes available such as Subway, Rail, Bus, Ferry etc. and non-motorized modes (Walk, Bicycle etc.), but you can also calculate and compare with other modes (Car). With regard to walking specifically, access to transit stops is often the most time-consuming part of a person's journey- being the quickest or shortest route.


While this guide does not cover everything about public transportation and all modes, it is a good starting point for anyone interested in understanding and measuring public transit equity, whether new to the subject or already familiar with public transportation  policy. It is a collection of existing and different ways and information that can be used to study equity in relation to public transit.


## Ideas to Keep In Mind When Measuring Spatial Public Transit Equity


<details><summary>1. Access varies depending on where you are (origin)</summary>Imagine living in downtown Chicago, where it is easy to catch a bus or hop on the subway to get to work, visit friends, or run errands. If the transit system is well-connected, and stops are just a short walk from your home, this could make it convenient for you to rely on public transportation. Now, if someone lives in a small rural town where public transit might be limited to a few bus routes that only run a couple of times a day. The nearest bus stop could be several miles away, making it inconvenient to rely on public transportation. At the same time, some individuals may find it convenient to obtain services near their work or shopping locations, indicating that daily activity spaces other than residential locations can be more representative of origin in measuring public transit calculations. This highlights the importance of origin (location) in accessibility decision making.</details>
<details><summary>2. Access takes in account the difficulty of traveling to a destination</summary>Consider the example below:<ul><li><strong>Apartment A</strong>: You are considering living in this apartment and the nearest bus stop is really close - only a 5-minute walk, and the bus comes often- every 10 minutes. However, the bus ride to downtown takes 20 minutes. Remember, walking to transit stops is often the most time-consuming part of a person's journey. Here, we can say that the difficulty involved in getting to your destination is low since the stop is closer, and the bus is frequent.</li><li><strong>Apartment B</strong>: You are considering living in this apartment and the nearest train station is close, only a 5-minute walk, but the train comes only every 30 minutes, and the ride downtown takes 25 minutes. The short walk is convenient, but the infrequent service increases the effort required as you may need to plan your trips carefully to avoid long waits, potentially limiting your flexibility and convenience.</li><li><strong>Apartment C</strong>: You are considering living in this apartment and the nearest subway station is a bit far - 15-minute walk, but the subway comes every 5 minutes, and the ride downtown takes only 10 minutes. The effort is higher due to the longer walk, but the subway is faster once you are on it.</li></ul></details>

<details><summary>3. Measuring access involves weighting how easily they can be reached</summary>In other words, opportunities that are closer and easier to reach are typically given more weight than those that are farther away or more challenging to access when determining the overall level of accessibility. Here, you are taking into account not just the distance to opportunities but also how convenient it is to reach them. The step below provides an example of how to quantify how easy it is for you to access public transit from your home:<ul><li><strong>Identify transit stops</strong>: First, list all the public transit stops (e.g., bus stops, train stations) within a certain radius of your home. For example, there might be five bus stops and two train stations nearby.</li><li><strong>Determine proximity</strong>: Next, measure the distance from your home to each of these transit stops. Suppose Bus Stop A is 0.5 miles away, Bus Stop B is 1 mile away, Train Station A is 2 miles away, and so on.</li><li><strong>Assess Ease of Access</strong>: Consider how easy it is to reach each transit stop. Bus Stop A, despite being closer, might be harder to reach due to a lack of sidewalks or heavy traffic, making it less convenient. On the other hand, Train Station A might be 2 miles away but easily accessible by a direct and frequent bus route.</li><li><strong>Weight the transit stops</strong>: Assign weights to each transit stop based on their proximity and ease of access. Closer and more convenient stops will have higher weights. For example:<ol><li>Bus Stop A: Weight = 0.6 (because itâ€™s close but difficult to walk to)</li><li>Bus Stop B: Weight = 0.8 (a bit farther but easier to reach)</li><li>Train Station A: Weight = 0.7 (farther away but very accessible by bus)</li></ol></li><li><strong>Calculate overall transit accessibility</strong>: Add up the weighted scores of all the transit stops to get an overall measure of how accessible public transit is from your home. For instance:<ol><li>Bus Stop A: 0.6</li><li>Bus Stop B: 0.8</li>li>Train Station A: 0.7</li><li>And so on...If you sum up these weighted values, you will get a total score that reflects how accessible public transit is for you. Higher scores indicate better accessibility, meaning that you have more convenient and nearby options for using public transit.</li></ol></li></ul></div></details>
