Do you use social determinants of health (SDOH) data on neighborhoods or communities in your research, advocacy work, and/or classroom? For example, you may regularly pull regional data on socioeconomic status (ie. income, poverty, educational attainment); community measures of historic or place-based racism (ie. redlining, segregation); or greenspace or other environmental indicators (ie. access to parks, vegetation indices, air quality, etc). 

The HEROP lab would love to hear from you! **We are developing an “SDOH Super User Group” to learn more about current practices and existing challenges of accessing SDOH data across a wide range of applications.** 

We hope to use information gathered at this meeting to support the development of a new SDOH [data discovery tool, and community toolkit](https://sdohplace.org/news/introducing-the-sdoh-place-project) to be launched as the [SDOH & Place Project](https://sdohplace.org/). This project is funded in part by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and findings and tools would be made free and open source. We also hope to further build, engage, and support a growing community of SDOH practitioners across campus and beyond. 

**For the UIUC Community**

Join us for brunch or a late lunch (you pick) at the Natural History Building to meet, connect, and chat about accessing community-level SDOH data. Participants will also receive an Amazon gift card ($25) for their time. RSVP Here: <https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/51005016>. 

**For the Wider Community**

We will host 1-2 Zoom-based virtual sessions to meet, connect, and chat about accessing community-level SDOH data. Participants will also receive an Amazon gift card ($25) for their time. We ask that you share more details about your use of SDOH data to help us make the best group.  Apply for a Spot Here: \[Link coming March 6th]. 

**The deadline to apply/RSVP will be Thursday, March 20th at 4:00 PM CDT.** If you have any additional questions, please contact Marc Astacio-Palmer (mastacio@illinois.edu).
