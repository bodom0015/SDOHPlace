In the interest of ensuring our projects are designed for those who will use the project, we at HEROP have partnered with two Advisory boards. Their role in the development of The SDOH and Place Project is to ensure that the project becomes the best version possible. To do this, we need to ensure that we work with a group that spans the entire breadth of user who might potentially utilize the SDOH & Place Project. As such, we have two distinct Advisory boards: The Stakeholder Advisory Board and the Technical Advisory Board. 

## The Stakeholder Advisory Board 

The stakeholder advisory board offers general guidance in what direction the SDOH & Place Project should go. This multi-disciplinary group offers advice on what they would like to see from the SDOH & Place Project.

## The Technical Advisory Board 

Similarly, the Technical Advisory Board also offers guidance to the SDOH & Place project, however, as the name implies, on a more data/engineering level.

Together, both Advisory groups work to ensure that the SDOH & Place project is the best that it can be.
