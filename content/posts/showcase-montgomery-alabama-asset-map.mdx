We begin our Fellow Showcase series with the **Montgomery, Alabama Asset Map** created by one of our Fellows: Amy Kryston. The following showcase has been written by Amy Kryston, with minor edits by our team.

## The Montgomery, Alabama Asset Map

We wanted to highlight the many available resources in Montgomery, Alabama, especially those directly related to physical wellness, emotional and community wellness, and public safety. We also wanted to create a central hub where residents could locate and learn about resources.

The primary goal of this asset map is to provide a resource to the community and to community health workers (CHWs). Secondary goals include: 

1. identifying health disparities
2. assessing access to health care and other resources
3. informing health policy and planning decisions. 

CHWs and community members must know where to access resources. It is also critical for city policy and programming to identify areas of social determinants of health (SDOH) deserts, to inform future resource development and allocation.

Community members and CHWs can utilize this map to find organizations or locations that can fill a need or address a challenge, specifically those related to the various SDOHs. This can also be used by policymakers at the City of Montgomery.

### Features

We are very excited that the current map provides information about various food resources, from farmers markets to cultural grocery stores to food pantries.

Also, recreation resources, like public parks and private gyms.

This is a very user-friendly map, and we've taken care to ensure it's accessible for most forms of color blindness and used other design knowledge. We are most proud, of course, of how we were able to engage the community and learn about what resources they were most interested in learning about.

### Upcoming Features

There is still much work we would like to do, including:

1. Adding more resource types (beyond food and recreation assets). 
2. Adding information about benefits, hours open, populations served, and more. 
3. Overlaying a map of public transit.

While there is on-going work, this is a working draft that can still be accessed by Montgomery, Alabama community members.

### Final Thoughts

Thank you to the community and City of Montgomery, Alabama, and the many wonderful partners and colleagues who aided in this project. And much thanks to this program. This work would not have been possible without the support of the SDOH & Place Fellowship!\
