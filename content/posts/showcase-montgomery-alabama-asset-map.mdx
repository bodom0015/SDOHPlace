We begin our Fellow Showcase series with the Montgomery, Alabama Asset Map created by one of our Fellows: Amy Kryston. To learn more about Amy Kryston, you can check out her profile on our website **here**.

## The Montgomery, Alabama Asset Map 

We wanted to highlight the many available resources in Montgomery, Alabama, especially those directly related to physical wellness, emotional and community wellness, and public safety. We also wanted to create a central hub where residents could locate and learn about resources.

The primary goal of this asset map is to provide a resource to the community and to community health workers (CHWs). Secondary goals include identifying health disparities, assessing access to health care and other resources, and informing health policy and planning decisions. CHWs and community members must know where to access resources. It is also critical for the City policy and programming to identify areas of SDOH deserts, to inform future resource development and allocation.

Community members and CHWs will be able to utilize this map to find organizations or locations that can fill a need or address a challenge, specifically those related to the various social determinants of health. This can also be used by policymakers at the City of Montgomery.

### Features 

We are very excited that the current map provides information about various different food resources, from farmers markets to cultural grocery stores to food pantries, and recreation resources, like public parks and private gyms. This is a very user-friendly map, and we've taken care to make sure it's accessible for most forms of color blindness and used other design knowledge. We are most proud, of course, of how we were able to engage the community and learn about what resources they were most interested in learning about.

### Upcoming Features

There is still much work we would like to do, including adding more resource types (beyond food and recreation assets), adding information about benefits, hours open, populations served, and more, and overlaying a map of public transit.

There is on-going work, but this is a working draft.
