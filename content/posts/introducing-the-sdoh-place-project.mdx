The Healthy Regions and Policies Lab, in partnership with the RWJF Foundation, is proud to introduce our latest project: The SDOH & PLACE project. A free web-based platform for place-based health equity data discovery and practice. 

## What does SDOH & PLACE data mean?

The [Social Determinants of Health](https://www.who.int/health-topics/social-determinants-of-health#tab=tab_1) (SDOH) are the conditions in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, & age that affect a range of health outcomes.

Place-based data about SDOH is often geospatial in nature, linking crucial information about the neighborhoods and regions in which people reside.

Ensuring all have easy access to harmonized, Place-Based SDOH data in which they live, work, advocate for, and/or research is crucial for health equity.
