The Community Member Fellowship is a part-time virtual fellowship sponsored by the team behind the SDOH & Place Project. This Fellowship is a 3-month project-based program that will take you through the community toolkit of the SDOH & Place Project. Throughout the program Fellows will learn how to develop their own SDOH place-based data dashboard/visualization including how to build it within a human-centered design (HCD) framework. Fellows will contribute to the community toolkit's final design and everyone within the field of health equity is encouraged to apply regardless of experience level. 

### The Community Toolkit

The Community Toolkit is part of the SDOH & Place Project. The final product will be a free web-based program dedicated to teaching individuals working within the field of health equity on how to build their own web-based applications working with SDOH and place-based data. In addition, in the spirit of accessibility, the toolkit will instruct users on how to complete their own project in line with HCD principles.

Human-Centered Design (HCD; formerly known as user-centered design) is a method of application design that includes the intended user of the product. This method involves four main components: understanding the use, specifying needs, designing solutions, and then evaluating. Web applications may be updated multiple times and thus necessitate constant interactions between developers, users, and the teams generating the application concept. In addition to creating an application that is designed to fit the needs of the audience that will use the product, HCD also offers benefits to the design team. As the user is implemented prior to the finalization of the application, the design team has a wonderful opportunity to refine their approach as the project develops. Additionally, as the user is able to specify their needs, resources are more effectively utilized on what the intended audience will actually use. This is especially useful for teams with limited resources (i.e., time, funding, labor, etc.). 

The outcome of the community toolkit will thus be threefold: 1) knowledge of how to build a web-based application that uses SDOH place-based data, 2) a product that is accessible to the intended audience, and therefore, more likely to be used by said audience, and 3) a product that is an effective use of time and resources for the design team.

### Time Commitment 

Early May. The total time commitment required from learners is about 40 hours split into the following:

* 2 hour workshops across 6 Fridays 
* 5 hours per module (learning & practice)
* 10 hours of development time to finalize and share prototype 

In addition, all fellows will be required to attend a 2-day conference in Chicago, IL June 14th & 15th 2024 to share/review final prototypes. Travel funding will be provided.

### Stipend

All Fellows will be given the following for the development of their project:

* $4-5,000 for the devlopment of the poposed project
* Travel funding to attend the 2-day conference in Chicago, IL June 14th-15th, 2024

The Fellowship application can be accessed here.
